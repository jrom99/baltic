    r"""
    Load a tree from a Nexus file and process it.

    Parameters:
    tree_path (str or file-like object): The path to the Nexus file or a file-like object containing the NEXUS formatted tree.
    tip_regex (str): A regular expression to extract dates from tip names. Default is '\|([0-9]+\-[0-9]+\-[0-9]+)'.
    date_fmt (str): The date format for the extracted dates. Default is '%Y-%m-%d'.
    treestring_regex (str): A regular expression to identify the tree string in the NEXUS file. Default is 'tree [A-Za-z\_]+([0-9]+)'.
    variableDate (bool): If True, allows for variable date formats. Default is True.
    absoluteTime (bool): If True, converts the tree to absolute time using the tip dates extracted from tip names. Default is True.
    verbose (bool): If True, prints verbose output during the process. Default is False.
    sortBranches (bool): If True, sorts the branches of the tree after loading. Default is True.

    Returns:
    tree: The tree object created from the NEXUS file.

    Raises:
    AssertionError: If the tree string cannot be found or if tip dates cannot be extracted when absoluteTime is True.

    Example:
    >>> tree = loadNexus("path/to/tree.nexus", absoluteTime=True, verbose=True)
